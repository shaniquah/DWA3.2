DWA_03: Documentation Knowledge Check 2

After what I learned about Gherkin Syntax, I was required to write user stories to describe the behaviour of the “+” and “-” buttons from the Tally Count app.

1. User story(ies) in Gherkin syntax for the “+” button. 
2. User story(ies) in Gherkin syntax for the “-” button.
